# C# 13 and .NET 9 Learning RepositoryU

This repository was created as part of my journey to learn **C# 13** and **.NET 9**, using the book [*C# 13 and .NET 9 â€“ Modern Cross-Platform Development Fundamentals*](https://www.amazon.com/13-NET-Cross-Platform-Development-Fundamentals/dp/183588122X) as the primary guide

## Learning Goals:
* Complete the book by the end of 2025
* Dedicate at least two ours per day to:
	* Reading
	* Researching related topics
	* Implementing code examples
	* Applying the knoledge through experimentation

## Repository purpose
This is a learning-focused repositoryr, so:
* No formal project structure is enforced
* No stric architectural patterns or best practices are guaranteED (since I'll be learning another programing language, I'll be focusing on the basics)
* The goal is experimentation, understanding, and prectice, not production-level code

## Notes!
Bellow I'll save alooooot of notes of the book, code, implementations, and anything related during this learning journey!!
